# NFT Trading Aggregator Skeleton

This repository contains a minimal Node.js server that demonstrates how to fetch NFT data from an external marketplace. It acts as a starting point for a website where users can explore or trade NFTs listed on various platforms.

## Features

- `GET /nfts` endpoint returns sample assets from OpenSea's public API.
- Shows how to call third-party NFT services. Extend this to integrate other marketplaces such as Rarible or LooksRare.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/nfts](http://localhost:3000/nfts) in a browser to view example results.

## Notes

- This example only retrieves public data and does not execute trades. Implementing trading or investment features requires interacting with smart contracts and marketplace APIs.
- Be sure to review the terms of service for each marketplace and comply with all local laws and regulations before enabling real transactions.
- This project is for educational purposes and does not provide legal or financial advice.
